This project includes Text Classification using SetFit architecture (Sentence Transformer Fine-Tuning)
I had a tsk to classify remarks into 15 topics. First, data preprocessing was required. I had to perform Lemmatization, Tokenization, cleaning etc. 
After that I fine tuned a pre-trained SetFit model using Cosine Similarity metric. 
The KPIs that were used were recall, precision, f1 and accuracy (Macro Average)
